# Setting up Blender + VS Code programmiong Environment
RefCOCO Synthetic 3D Dataset Generation

For VS Code + Blender integration follow CG Python's tutorial [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUytEtaVrrc), [macOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0srGXAzBZE), [Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP0s1i9EXeM)), although would recommend using Anaconda for virtual environment.

Post tutorial, to quickly run new python code from blender with hotkey:
1) Open python script file in VS Code
2) Open VS Code's Command Palette (CTL/CMD + SHIFT + P) and type in "Blender: Start"
4) In Blender, open up your in-progress project (if you have one)
5) To define a custom hotkey for running your scrip in VS Code, in VS Code's Command Palette, start typig in "Blend: Run Script" and click on the settings gear icon to the right of "Blend: Run Script" (see image below)

  Change the "Keybinding" to whatever hotkey you want to use for running the script.
